## Client's Evaluation

<img style="max-width:100%" src="{{ "/images/client_evaluation.jpg" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" />

Our client was satisfied with the final product and felt that it was exactly what he had in mind at the start of the project. He think that the application was well designed and met all his requirements. His only concern was about the extensibility of the project as he wish to incorporate new features in the future. As the team applied Model View Controller pattern which separate the application logic from the user interface and data model, new features can be easily added to the existing application. 

## Teamâ€™s Evaluation

We felt that the we achieved our objective for the project by delivering a usable prototype and manage to launch it on an actual remote server. We were able to fulfil most of the initial requirements. We also managed to maintain a good relationship with our client and received his support on the suggestions we made to the requirements during the development phase. Our testing feedbacks were mostly positive with just a few minor issues on our design. With further development in mind, we managed to keep our code structure simple and ensure that it is easy to understand too.
