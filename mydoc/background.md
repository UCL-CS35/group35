## Our Client

Dr. Jeremy I Skipper from The Language, Action and Brain Lab. The Language, Action and Brain Lab (or LAB Lab) is located in the Institute for Multimodal Communication (IfMC) in Experimental Psychology at the University College London. LAB Lab aim to understand the neurobiology of natural language user. At LAB Lab, research is done to understand the organization of language in the brain that includes context, both internal like past experiences hearing words and external like mouth movements.

## Context

Traditionally, neuroscientists use isolated words as stimuli while capturing brain images to investigate how the brain reacts. However, Dr. Skipperâ€™s research has a more natural approach, using movies as stimuli. As currently there are a limited number of neuroscientists participating in collecting data for this research, he envisions a database where other neuroscientists could submit their data after collection, and where everyone can view the captured images and associated terms of brain processing functions when watching different movies.

## Problem Statement

Our client has built a database of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data collected while people watch full length films. Currently, the database is only accessible to the client and he has to collect the data by himself.

## Project Aim

Internet Neurocinematics Database (INcDb) will be hosted online and make accessible to the public. INcDb will advance knowledge transfer as it allows public to find out which brain network is active when watching movie. Scientists who collect fMRI data, while people watch full length films, can upload their data to INcDb.

## Success Criteria

* __Performance__ - Website should load smoothly and quickly.

* __User Experience__ - Website should be easy to use and simple to understand even for non-technical users.

* __Reliability__ - Website should have a data uploading function that is smooth, efficient and reliable.
