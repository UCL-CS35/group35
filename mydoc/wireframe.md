After a group discussion on our sketches, we decided to implement these ideas to create a simple flow chart of the website. We wanted to develop a better understanding to how we, as users of the website, would get around. Thatâ€™s why we constructed a simple wireframe using the sketches to build a simple user interface using flowchart software (draw.io), and outline of the website. 

The astehetic design of the wireframe is kept to the minimal as the focus is on the flow and layout of the application.
