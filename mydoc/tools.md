## Facebook Groups

We uses a private Facebook Group as our main communication tools. We create Facebook Event for the meetings we have with our client so that it sync with our personal calendar. We also use the comments feature to keep our discussion focus on the issue that the Post is about.

## Word Online

We uses Word Online to collaborate on our Bi-Weekly Reports. Word Online allows members to work on the document at the same time. The ability to edit using the full version of Microsft Word is the main reason for choosing Word Online over other collaborating tools like Google Docs.
