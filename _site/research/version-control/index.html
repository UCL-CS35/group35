<p>We will be using Git for our version control system.</p>

<p>We shortlisted GitHub and Bitbucket as the possible options for hosting our project source codes. Bitbucket is an hosting service for Git repositories. It is attractive to small group (up to 5 members) who want to host their private projects online. GitHub is another hosting service provider but their free plan requires group to keep their code public. As our projectâ€™s aim is to make a research study available to the public, our client has no objection on keeping the source code public. By having a public repository, interested developers can submit fixes or new features to improve INcDb. Lastly, GitHub is a also a better option for beginners like us as there is a huge community support available. We decided to use GitHub to host all our source codes and they are available at https://github.com/UCL-CS35.</p>

<p>We will be adopting Git Flow for our Git branching model. In our central repo, origin, we will have 2 main branches with infinite lifetime: master and develop. The origin/master always reflect a production-ready state. The origin/develop always reflect a state with the latest delivered development changes for the next release.</p>

<p>When origin/develop branch is ready to be release, all of the changes will be merged back into origin/master and then tagged with a release number. Each time when changes are merged back into origin/master, we will automatically build and roll-out our software to our production servers.</p>

<p>We will be using three supporting branches, namely Feature, Release, Hotfix branches. Feature branches may branch off from: develop, must merge back into: develop, has a branch naming convention: anything except master, develop, release-, or hotfix-. Feature branches are used to develop new features for the future release. Feature branches exist in developer repos only, not in origin.</p>
