<p>After a group discussion on our sketches, we decided to implement these ideas to create a simple flow chart of the website. We wanted to develop a better understanding to how we, as users of the website, would get around. Thatâ€™s why we constructed a simple wireframe using the sketches to build a simple user interface using flowchart software (draw.io), and outline of the website.</p>

<p>The astehetic design of the wireframe is kept to the minimal as the focus is on the flow and layout of the application.</p>

<p>The full wireframe can be found at <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_L13V4oU0QTOUZKaHlGalpCdk0/view?usp=sharing?">https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_L13V4oU0QTOUZKaHlGalpCdk0/view?usp=sharing?</a></p>
