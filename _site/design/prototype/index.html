<p>With our finalised Photoshop Mockups, we started developing a HTML/CSS design prototype. The aim of the prototype was to experiement with the UI components of the Bootstrap framework.</p>

<p>By building a clickable prototype, the group and stakeholders will have a clear idea on the feel and look of the project.</p>
