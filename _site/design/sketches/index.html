<p>After our first meeting with Dr.Skipper, we decided that each group member need to spring up their own interpretation of the design for the website with a simple sketch. We would then discuss on the ideas and objectives we had in mind from these drawings and upon these sketches, we would build a basic foundation for the website. The followings are our sketches for the project. They include flowchart of the application and logo for the project.</p>
